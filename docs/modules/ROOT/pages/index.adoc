= Introduction To Microservice


== Microservice Architecture

Before dive in to the framework, let's have the basic idea of microservice architecture.
A microservice' architecture consists of a collection of small, autonomous services.
Each service is self-contained and should implement a single business capability within a bounded context.
A bounded context is a natural division within a business and provides an explicit boundary within which a domain model exists.

*What are microservices?*

Microservices are a modern approach to software whereby application code is delivered in small, manageable pieces, independent of others.

=== Key characteristics of microservices include

[arabic]
. *Modularity*: Each microservice is a self-contained unit that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
This modularity allows for easier development and maintenance of complex systems.
. *Scalability*: Since each service is independent, it can be scaled horizontally or vertically based on its specific requirements.
This allows for better resource utilization and improved performance.
. *Resilience*: Microservices are designed to be fault-tolerant and resilient.
If one service fails, it does not necessarily affect the entire application, as other services can continue to function independently.
. *Flexibility*: Microservices allow for flexibility in technology choices.
Each service can be developed using the most suitable programming language, framework, or database for its requirements.
. *Decentralized Data Management*: Instead of a single centralized database, each microservice can have its own database or data store.
This allows for better isolation of data and reduces the risk of data corruption or loss.
. *Continuous Deployment*: Microservices enable continuous deployment and delivery practices, as each service can be deployed independently without affecting others.
This allows for faster release cycles and quicker time-to-market.

== Database Per Service Pattern

One of the benefits of microservice architecture is that it lets us choose the technology stack per service.
For instance, we can decide to use a relational database for service A and opt for a NoSQL database for service B. This model lets the services manage domain data independently on a data store that best suites its data types and schema.
Further, it also lets the service scale its datastore on-demand and insulates it from the failures of other services.
However, at times a transaction can span across multiple services, and ensuring data consistency across the service database is a challenge.

== Distributed Transaction

In the microservice architecture, a distributed transaction refers to a transaction that spans multiple microservices.
Traditional monolithic applications often use a single database and ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions to ensure data integrity within a single transaction.
However, in the microservice environment, each microservice typically has its own database or data store, and transactions may need to span multiple services.

As an example, Just imagine that there is an e-commerce application that makes online orders, and it has been implemented with microservice architecture.
In general, the following microservices can be involved to make the entire order placing request.

* order-service
** initialize the order.
** update the order status
* payment-service
** make pre-auth
** make real payment
* Stock-service
** update the inventory, and so on.

Even though the entire transaction is pace-order, that transaction has many sub atomic-transactions.
Those transactions have been distributed along with many microservices.
Each service performs a signal local transaction to implement the individual functionalities.

To make a successful transaction, all 4 atomic-transactions (three microservices) must be completed.
If any of the microservices fails to complete one of the local transactions, all the completed atomic transactions until where the failure happened should be rolled back to ensure data integrity.

As per the example, if the *make-payment* atomic transaction (transaction-4) is failed, all other successfully executed transactions should be rolled back to ensure data integrity.

== Challenges of Distributed Transaction

Distributed transactions in a microservice architecture pose two key challenges.
The first one is maintaining ACID.

* *Atomicity across services* (maintaining ACID)
+
To ensure the correctness of a transaction, it must be an atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable (ACID).
The atomicity ensures that all or none of the steps of a transaction should complete.
Consistency takes data from one valid state to another valid state.
Isolation guarantees that concurrent transactions should produce the same result that sequentially transactions would have produced.
Lastly, durability means that committed transactions remain committed irrespective of any type of system failure.
In a distributed transaction scenario, as the transaction spans several services, it always remains a key concern to ensure ACID.

* *Managing the transaction isolation level.*
+
It specifies the amount of data that is visible in a transaction when the other services access the same data simultaneously.
In other words, if one object in one of the microservices is persisted in the database while another request reads the data, should the service return the old or new data?
