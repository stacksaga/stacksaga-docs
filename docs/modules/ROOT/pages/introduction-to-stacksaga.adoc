= Introduction to StackSaga

== Overview

StackSaga is a comprehensive Saga ecosystem for building resilient, distributed transactions in microservice-based architectures.

At its core, StackSaga provides Saga Orchestrator Engines — components that coordinate multistep workflows across services by executing local transactions and their compensating actions.
But StackSaga goes far beyond just orchestration — it delivers an entire platform for designing, running, and observing long-running business processes.

== What is StackSaga?

StackSaga is an ecosystem rather than a single library.
It provides everything needed to implement, observe, and maintain Saga-based distributed transactions in the real world.

. *xref:stacksaga-engines:engine-overview.adoc[]* +
Multiple orchestration engines for synchronous (request/response) and asynchronous (event-driven) communication styles.
. *xref:stacksaga-database-support:overview/database-support-overview.adoc[Database Support for Event Sourcing]* +
StackSaga brings built-in event-sourcing capabilities and provides database support dependencies, enabling you to use your existing primary database as the event store — no need to set up a separate storage system.

. *xref:stacksaga-service-discovery-support:overview/stacksaga-environment-support.adoc[Environment & Integration Support]* +
Modules for integrating with critical infrastructure such as Eureka (service discovery), Kubernetes (K8s), and other environment-specific tools to make StackSaga cloud-native ready.

. *xref:stacksaga-agent:overview/stacksaga-agent.adoc[Stacksaga Agents]* +
Dedicated retry agents for asynchronous transaction retry scheduling.

. *xref:stacksaga-admin:stacksaga-cloud-window.adoc[Transaction Tracing Dashboard]* +
A visual dashboard for developers and operators to trace every transaction step, see event histories, and perform manual interventions (like retry or cancel).

== Why StackSaga?

Modern microservices architectures demand:

* Reliable coordination between services for long-running processes

* Transparent error handling & compensation mechanisms

* Traceability for debugging and compliance audits

* Seamless integration with cloud environments (Eureka, K8s, etc.)

StackSaga addresses all of these with a single cohesive ecosystem, removing the friction of piecing together multiple frameworks or ad-hoc solutions.

== How StackSaga Benefits Developers & Teams

* 🚀 Unified Ecosystem – One solution covering orchestration, event-sourcing, and monitoring.

* 🛡 Resilient Transactions – Built-in retries and compensations ensure workflows don’t break.

* 📊 Full Observability – Trace every step with the StackSaga Dashboard.

* ⚙️ Simplified Infrastructure – Use existing databases for event storage; integrate easily with K8s and service registries.
