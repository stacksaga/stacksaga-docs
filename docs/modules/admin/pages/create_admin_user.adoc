Step-2::
After submitting the data you will have the `username` and a temporary `generated password`.
The temporary password helps to complete the account with the real password for the real user.

Step-3::
After creating the admin user account, the super admin can manage the access for services like if the new admin can access all the services or not, or it can be added to specific services one by one.
As an example if you want to have a user for the `payment-account-service` service, you can mention that user can only access the  `payment-account-service`.

When trying to log in with the temporary `generated password` the user will be asked for creating a new password for activate the account.
