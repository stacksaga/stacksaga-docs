=== Create API Gateway User [[create_api_gateway_user]]

To communicate individual services with the admin, StackSaga Connect should be used and therefore, to protect the *`/stacksaga`* endpoints, StackSaga shield also should be used.
To use the StackSaga shield with the api gateway, we have to create a *`ROLE_GATEWAY`* user and get the credentials.
Let's go to the StackSaga Admin dashboard and create a new user for a new api-gateway step by step. +
Read <<stacksaga_high_level,StackSaga architecture in high-level>> page to get the idea how to behave the ecosystem.

. Go to the *user's* page and select the *Registration* tab to register the new api gateway user. +

. Before adding the gateway user, we have to create a new api-gateway (because in the StackSaga system, one api-gateway-can have multiple gateway-users.) +
