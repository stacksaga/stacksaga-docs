=== StackSaga Admin involvement in the StackSaga ecosystem.

To have a better understanding, let's have look how the involvement of `StackSaga Admin` in the ecosystem.

StackSaga-Admin is a partial stateless application.
Because, even though you can see the transaction tracing and other data in the dashboard, that data is not saved in the admin's database.
The data coming from the Individual event-stores.

You know that in StackSaga, StackSaga-framework uses an event-store for storing the transaction data.
As per xref://[this article], it can be a single event-store or most probably, it can be multiple event-stores for each orchestrator service.
The transaction's data is saved on those event-stores separately.

Let's see how the StackSaga-Admin fetches the transaction data from the Individual event-stores.

When you add the StackSaga-framework in your utility services, it has inbuilt endpoints for expose the data to the outside world.
[ See the xref://[endpoints here]. ]

<2>  When the connect button is clicked the cross border request goes to the target URL and the the api gateway or any proxy server will navigate the request to one of available instances of the target service with your user credentials that you logged to the admin dashboard.
<3> After receiving the request in to the order service all the requests are filtered by Stacksaga if the request has a /stacksaga/.. prefix. If it has the request catches by the Stacksaga framework make new request to the configured admin server with your credentials and as we as the server's credentials to verify both user and server has the authority to access the particular request.

<5> Both user's token and service user credentials are validated

6. Stacksaga framework grants the authority to access the event store through the Stacksaga endpoints if the credentials are valid. Or otherwise the request is rejected with the response that given by the admin backend to the admin dashboard back.
