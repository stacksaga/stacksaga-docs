|`spring.profiles.active` | `-`  | `String` | There are two profiles available as `eureka` and `k8s`.
You can choose one of them based on the deployment environment.
|`spring.application.name` | `-`  | `String` | The name of the agent application.
|`server.port` | `8080`  | `int` | The port of the agent service.

[.red]*NOTE:* Due to Agent service internally uses default *{data_source}* for managing connection, It can be configured the datasource properties in the same way that spring boot provides. +
The prefix is `{data_source_prefix}`.
|`stacksaga.agent.target-service` | - | `String` | The name of the target service.
(The transactions are fetched based on this name from the event-store) |`stacksaga.agent.target-service-host` | - | `String` | The host name of the target service that retry tasks should be submitted to.

*Thread-Pool of Parallel Processing:* Agent service uses a thread-pool to process the retry tasks in parallel.
Each thread is responsible for processing one or more partitions (virtual nodes).

|`stacksaga.agent.local-partition-count` | `Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors()`  | `int` | how many local partitions (virtual nodes) should be created to process the retry in parallel. by default, it is set to the number of available processors. the entire token range is divided into these partitions, and each partition is assigned to one thread.

|`stacksaga.agent.buffer-size` | `1000`  | `int` | how many records should be fetched in one batch from the event-store when retrying the failed transactions.

|`stacksaga.agent.retry.delay-in-minutes` | `2`  | `int` | how often the retry task should be executed. every 2 minutes triggers the retry task based on UTC time.

|`stacksaga.agent.internal-communication.retry-delay` | `Duration`  | `1s` | the delay between each retry attempt for internal service communication failures.

|`stacksaga.agent.internal-communication.max-retry-attempts` | `3`  | `int` | the maximum number of retry attempts for internal service communication failures.
