= Idempotence Support

== What is the idempotence?

Idempotence in the distributed system refers to the ability of a system to handle duplicate requests or retries without altering the system's state beyond the first application of the request.
In other words, it allows sending the same request multiple times, and it will only affect the system once.
Even if the same request is accidentally repeated due to network issues or retries, the result will be the same as if the request was made just one time.

== Why is Idempotence Important in Microservices?

In microservices architecture, services are often distributed and communicate over unreliable networks.
As a result:

* *Failures and Retries:* When a request fails due to network issues or system crashes, the client may retry the request.
Without idempotence, multiple retries could lead to inconsistent data or unexpected behavior.
* *Asynchronous Messaging:* When using message queues, brokers may send the same message multiple times if acknowledgment is not received, or due to delivery guarantees such as "at-least-once."
* *Concurrency:* Multiple instances of a service might attempt to process the same request or data at the same time, and idempotence ensures that this doesn't lead to incorrect results.
For example, imagine a microservice responsible for billing.
If a charge is applied twice due to a retry, the customer could be billed multiple times without idempotence in place.
