= Maintaining Idempotency

== What is the idempotence?


////
Idempotence in the distributed system refers to the ability of a system to handle duplicate requests or retries without altering the system's state beyond the first application of the request.
In other words, it allows sending the same request multiple times, and it will only affect the system once.
Even if the same request is accidentally repeated due to network issues or retries, the result will be the same as if the request was made just one time.
////


Idempotency in microservices architecture means that making *multiple identical requests* to a service will have the *same effect* as making a single request. This ensures that operations are *safe to retry* without causing unintended side effects, which is especially important in distributed systems where failures and retries are common.


== Why is Idempotence Important in Microservices?

In microservices architecture, services are often distributed and communicate over unreliable networks.
As a result:

* *Failures and Retries:* When a request fails due to network issues or system crashes, the client may retry the request.
Without idempotence, multiple retries could lead to inconsistent data or unexpected behavior.
* *Asynchronous Messaging:* When using message queues, brokers may send the same message multiple times if acknowledgment is not received, or due to delivery guarantees such as "at-least-once."
* *Concurrency:* Multiple instances of a service might attempt to process the same request or data at the same time, and idempotence ensures that this doesn't lead to incorrect results.
For example, imagine a microservice responsible for billing.
If a charge is applied twice due to a retry, the customer could be billed multiple times without idempotence in place.

== Examples of Idempotent and Non-Idempotent Operations

=== Idempotent Requests:

* GET /orders/123 → Fetching an order multiple times does not change the system state.

* PUT /orders/123 → Updating an order with the same data multiple times results in the same final state.

* DELETE /orders/123 → Deleting an order multiple times has the same effect as deleting it once.

=== Non-Idempotent Requests:

* POST /orders → Creating a new order each time a request is sent leads to multiple orders being created.

== Implementing Idempotency

Use Idempotency Keys: Clients send a unique request ID (X-Idempotency-Key) to prevent duplicate processing.

Check Before Processing: Maintain a record of processed requests to ensure duplicate ones are ignored.

Design APIs Correctly: Prefer PUT over POST where applicable.

Use Database Constraints: Enforce unique constraints to prevent duplicate entries.

== Why Idempotency is Important with Retries?

. Prevents Duplicate Transactions
+
Suppose a payment service processes a POST /payments request.
If the client does not receive a response due to a network failure and retries, the same payment might be processed twice, leading to double charges for the customer.
+
With idempotency, the service can recognize the repeated request and ensure it is processed only once.

. Ensures Data Integrity +
Without idempotency, retrying a non-idempotent operation (like adding money to a wallet) might result in incorrect balances.
+
Example:
+
First request: POST /wallets/123/add?amount=100 → Balance: $100
+
Retry due to failure: POST /wallets/123/add?amount=100 → Balance: $200 (Incorrect!)
+
With idempotency, the service checks if the request has already been processed and ensures the balance remains correct.

. Avoids Partial Updates & Inconsistencies
+
In distributed transactions, a microservice might update multiple databases or services.
If retries happen without idempotency, it could lead to partially completed operations.
+
Example:
+
Step 1: Service A debits an account.
+
Step 2: Service B fails before updating the order status.
+
Step 3: The client retries, causing another debit.
+
Idempotency ensures only one successful debit happens, even with multiple retries.

. Improves System Resilience
+
Many microservices frameworks (e.g., Spring Retry, Resilience4j, Kubernetes Liveness Probes) automatically retry failed requests.
+
If a service is not idempotent, automatic retries might overload the system with unintended duplicate requests.


=== How to Ensure Idempotency in Retried Requests in General?

. Use an Idempotency Key
+
The client sends a unique request ID (e.g., X-Idempotency-Key: 12345).
+
The server checks if the request has already been processed.
+
If processed, return the stored response instead of executing it again.

. Store Processed Requests
+
Maintain a record of processed requests in a database or cache to avoid reprocessing.

. Use Database Constraints
+
Enforce unique constraints in the database (e.g., unique order ID for payments).

. Prefer PUT over POST
+
PUT /orders/123 ensures the same order update happens only once, even if retried.

== How Idempotency is used in the Stacksaga framework?

In StackSaga, service communication requests are processed within the executors.
The SEC assigns a unique identifier key to each atomic transaction, and you can access it inside each executor.
For example, if you have a long-running transaction like placing an order and if it consists of five atomic transactions, it has to create five executors for handling the invocations.
Within each executor, the SEC provides an idempotency key and, that Idempotency key can be used for passing over the requests instead of maintaining idempotency keys manually.
See the implementation here.

NOTE: The Idempotency key is generated by combining the transaction-ID (Aggregator Transaction ID) and the executor's name by default.
Even though the executor is executed many times for retrying, the Idempotency key of that particular executor will be the same all the time.
