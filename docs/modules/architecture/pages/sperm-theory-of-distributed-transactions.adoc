= Sperm Theory Of Distributed Transactions

The Sperm Theory of Distributed Transactions explores the potential failure stages and probabilities within distributed transactions, along with their respective impacts on distributed systems.
While the occurrence of certain failures may be negligible in terms of frequency or impact under typical circumstances, they cannot be dismissed outright.
These edge cases, though rare, demand careful consideration during system implementation to ensure overall robustness and resilience.

As a widely adopted industry solution, the SAGA design pattern serves as a cornerstone for ensuring consistency across distributed systems, often in collaboration with complementary design patterns and architectural frameworks.
However, at the implementation level, certain rare but critical failures can still be observed, emphasizing the need for robust failure-handling strategies and continuous monitoring.

As you can see, most of the transactions are successful in general.
As well as a tiny portion is exposed for some issues like the tail. if we consider the sperm as all the transactions, the head of the sperm is the successful transactions it acquires a huge percentage of the total.

The following is the list of the most common failures.

. Successful transactions
. Primary-Execution failed transactions.
. Incomplete transactions
. Retry-Timeout transactions
. Missing transactions
. Revert-Failed transactions.


== 1. Successful transactions.

These are transactions that complete as intended, achieving the desired outcome without errors.
In most systems, the majority of transactions fall into this category.
From the Stacksaga perspective, a transaction is considered successful when all executors complete their tasks without encountering any exceptions or failures.

== 2. Primary-Execution failed transactions

Based on the logical conditions in the code, some transactions may have a primary execution failure.
(These errors are not considered as errors.
Because it is used for stopping to forward the transaction and to start the compensation process.) In stacksaga perspective, a non-retryable exception is thrown through one of the executors while the transaction is being executed.

== 3. Reverting-Failed Transactions.

If the transaction is failed during the compensation process due to some unhandled exception, it is called as reverting failed transactions.

[[incomplete_transactions]]
== 4. Incomplete transactions. (Crashed transaction)

In microservices architecture, one business transaction consists of multiple sub-transactions (atomic-transactions).
So if one atomic transaction is crashed (the crash can be occurred due to various reasons like Power Outage, hardware failure, etc.) without any update (fallback), the entire transaction is stuck.
Because the atomic transactions of the business transaction are executed in sequence order in general.

[[missing_transactions]]
== 5. Missing transactions

In the asynchronous retrying process, the transactions are transformed for retrying to the available services (it can be via a queue or http request or any other mechanism). while the process of the transaction can be missing without being executed.

In asynchronous retry processes, transactions are transferred for execution to available services through mechanisms such as queues, HTTP requests, or other communication channels.
However, during this process, a transaction may be lost or fail to execute due to issues like message loss, queue mismanagement, or communication failures.
These missing transactions can lead to inconsistencies and require careful monitoring and recovery strategies.

NOTE: xref:incomplete_transactions[Incomplete-Transactions] and xref:missing_transactions[Missing transactions] are quite similar at first glance.
But *Incomplete-transactions* term forces the dual-consistency problem.
That means the consistency between the event-store and the real database.
But *Missing Transactions* term forces the transactions that are missing without achieving both of them.

At first glance, Incomplete Transactions and Missing Transactions may appear similar, but they address distinct challenges:

Incomplete Transactions highlight the dual-consistency problem, focusing on the lack of consistency between the event store and the primary database.
In these cases, the transaction partially progresses but leaves the system in an inconsistent state.

Missing Transactions, on the other hand, refer to transactions that fail to execute entirely.
These transactions are neither recorded in the event store nor reflected in the primary database, effectively vanishing without leaving a trace.

== 6. Retry-Timeout transactions

In distributed systems, transactions are retried within a specific time frame.
If the retry limit is exceeded, the transaction is frozen and will not be retried automatically.
This can happen due to long service downtimes, network issues, or high system load.
To resolve these transactions, manual intervention is needed to identify and fix the problem before reactivating the transaction.
