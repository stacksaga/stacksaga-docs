= Introduction to the Saga Design Pattern

== Overview

In modern distributed systems, handling *long-running transactions* across multiple microservices is a significant challenge.
The Saga pattern addresses this by breaking them into a series of smaller, isolated transactions that can be individually committed and compensated.

[[what_is_saga_architecture_pattern]]
== What is the Saga Pattern?

The Saga pattern is a microservices architectural pattern that ensures data consistency across multiple services without relying on distributed transactions.
A saga is a sequence of local transactions where each transaction updates data within a single service.
If a transaction fails, a series of compensating transactions are executed to undo the changes made by the previous transactions, thereby maintaining consistency eventually.
In the Saga pattern, a compensating transaction must be *xref:ROOT:idempotency.adoc[idempotent]* and *retryable*.
These two principles ensure that a transaction can be managed without any manual intervention.
The Saga Execution Coordinator (SEC) ensures guarantees those principles.

The below diagram shows how to visualize the Saga pattern for the previously discussed online order processing scenario.

== Types of Saga

There are two primary types of saga implementations:

[arabic]
. *Choreography-based Saga*
* In this approach, each service involved in the saga performs its local transaction and publishes an event.
Other services listen to these events and react accordingly, performing their transactions and emitting subsequent events.
This continues until all transactions in the saga are complete.
* *Pros*: No central coordination needed, leading to simpler scalability.
* *Cons*: Increased complexity in managing the flow of events and handling failures.
. *Orchestration-based Saga*
* This approach introduces a central coordinator or orchestrator that manages the entire saga flow.
The orchestrator sends commands to each service to perform its transaction and waits for their responses.
If a transaction fails, the orchestrator triggers compensating transactions to revert the changes.
* *Pros*: Centralized control simplifies management and error handling.
* *Cons*: The orchestrator can become a single point of failure and may require sophisticated state management.

[[saga_orchestration_pattern]]
== Saga Orchestration Pattern

*Saga Orchestration* involves a central orchestrator that controls the flow of a saga, dictating the order of operations and handling any necessary compensating in case of failure.
The orchestrator takes on the responsibility of managing the entire transaction process, making decisions about which steps to execute next and how to handle errors.

=== Key Characteristics:

[arabic]
. *Centralized Control*: The orchestrator centrally manages the saga, ensuring that each step is executed in the correct order and coordinating compensating if a step fails.
. *Simplified Microservices*: Microservices do not need to be aware of the overall transaction flow.
They simply perform their individual tasks and report back to the orchestrator.
. *Error Handling*: The orchestrator manages error handling and compensating, simplifying the logic in individual services.
. *Execution Flow*: The orchestrator sends commands to services to perform actions, waits for their responses, and then decides the next step based on those responses.

[[eventual_consistency]]
== Eventual Consistency

*Definition:* Eventual consistency guarantees that, if no new updates are made to a given piece of data, eventually all accesses to that data will return the last updated value.
Over time, the system will converge to a consistent state, but it does not provide immediate consistency after an update.

*Characteristics:*

* *Latency:* Eventual consistency allows for lower latency as updates can propagate in the background.
* *Availability:* High availability is often achieved since the system can operate even if some nodes are temporarily unreachable.
* *Partition Tolerance:* It can handle network partitions more gracefully, ensuring the system remains operational despite disruptions.
* *Use Cases:* Suitable for systems where immediate consistency is not critical, such as DNS, web caches, and some NoSQL databases (e.g., Cassandra, DynamoDB).

*Example:* A social media platform where user profiles may not immediately reflect the latest changes across all servers.
Eventually, all servers will have the same profile data, but there might be a delay.

NOTE: Eventual consistency is often used in the saga design pattern, particularly in the context of distributed systems and microservices architectures.

== Eventual Consistency in Saga

*Nature of Saga*

* *Long-Running-Transactions:* Saga breaks a large transaction into a series of smaller, independent transactions that can be managed separately across different services.
* *Compensating Actions:* If a transaction in the saga fails, compensating actions are triggered to revert the previous transactions.

*Eventual Consistency:*

* *Asynchronous Execution:* Because transactions in a saga are executed asynchronously and independently, immediate consistency is not guaranteed.
Instead, the system achieves eventual consistency as each step in the saga completes and as compensating actions resolve any issues from failed steps.
* *Consistency Model:* Eventual consistency is a natural fit for saga, as it allows for high availability and partition tolerance.
The system remains operational and available even as it progresses towards a consistent state.
* *Recovery and Retries:* Saga often include mechanisms for retrying failed transactions and handling transaction errors, further supporting the eventual consistency model.

== Challenges and Considerations Of using Saga

* *Complexity*: Implementing and managing saga requires careful planning and design, especially for failure recovery.
* *Idempotency*: Ensuring that compensating transactions are idempotent (safe to run multiple times) is crucial to avoid inconsistent states.
* *State Management*: Keeping track of the state of the saga and handling retries can add complexity, particularly in orchestration-based saga.

StackSaga framework provides an easy way to overcome these Challenges along with more additional features.
