|`spring.profiles.active` | `-`  | `String` |  There are two profiles available as `eureka` and `k8s`. You can choose one of them based on the deployment environment.
|`spring.application.name` | `-`  | `String` |  The name of the agent application. It is recommended to use this format: `target-service-name-agent`. For instance if deploying s agent service for `order-service` the agent service name will be `order-service-agent`.
|`server.port` | `5566`  | `int` |  The port of the agent service.

*NOTE:* Due to StackSaga Mysql-Agent internally uses https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/appendix/application-properties/index.html#application-properties.data.spring.datasource.url[spring default datasource] and https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/appendix/application-properties/index.html#application-properties.data.spring.datasource.hikari[HikariCP] for managing the connection pool, It can be configured the datasource properties in the same way that spring boot provides. +
The prefix is `stacksaga.datasource`
|`stacksaga.agent.keyspace` | `stacksaga_event_store`  | `String` |  The keyspace(Database) name of the event-store.
|`stacksaga.agent.target-service-host` | -  | `String` |  The host name of the target service that retry tasks should be submitted to.
|`stacksaga.agent.target-service` | -  | `String` |  The name of the target service. (The transactions are fetched based on this name from the event-store)
|`stacksaga.agent.act-master-as-slave` | `true`  | `boolean` |  Whether the master service acts as the slave or not. If the cluster is small, you can run one instance and run as the master and as well as the slave.
|`stacksaga.agent.IOPool.core-pool-size` | `available processors * 10`  | `int` |  core number of threads in the IOPool.
|`stacksaga.agent.IOPool.maximum-pool-size` | `available processors * 30`  | `int` |  maximum number of threads in the IOPool.
|`stacksaga.agent.IOPool.keep-alive-time` | `60000(ms)`  | `long` |  the time limit for which threads may remain idle before being terminated.
|`stacksaga.agent.IOPool.queue-capacity` | `Integer.MAX_VALUE`  | `int` | the capacity of the queue.
|`stacksaga.agent.IOPool.await-termination-period` | `10000(ms)`  | `int` | the maximum time the executor is supposed to block on shutdown.
|`stacksaga.agent.retry-pool.pool-size` | `available processors * 1`  | `int` |  core number of threads in the IOPool.
|`stacksaga.agent.retry-pool.keep-alive-time` | `60000(MILLIS)`  | `long` |  the time limit for which threads may remain idle before being terminated.

|`stacksaga.agent.retry-initial-delay` | `60000(ms)`  | `long` | how long to wait before retrying the transaction at the beginning of the application.
|`stacksaga.agent.retry-fixed-rate` | `60000(ms)`  | `long` | the fixed rate for retrying the transaction. As per the default value, the transaction retry process is repeated every 60 seconds. *The executions are not overlapped even the old execution exceeds the interval*
|`stacksaga.agent.retry-batch-size` | `1000`  | `int` |  The name of the target service. The number of transactions that should be fetched from the event-store for each batch.
