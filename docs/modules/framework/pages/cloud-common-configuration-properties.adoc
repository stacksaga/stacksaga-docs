|`stacksaga.cloud.transactionRetryCron` | 0 0/5 * * * ?  | Cron String |  The scheduler for replaying the transactions that are waiting to be run in the event-store.(The transactions that have been temporally stopped due to network issues). This configuration is used only oof the instance is the leader in the region.
|`stacksaga.cloud.applicationStabilizationPeriod` | 5  | Duration by minutes | The scheduler that you configured for retrying the transaction  (`stacksaga.cloud.transactionRetryCron`) is worked after some delay. Because the instance should be stable for acting as the leader. This configuration is used only oof the instance is the leader in the region.
|`stacksaga.cloud.crashedTransactionRestoreRetentionHours` | 12  | Duration by hours | How long the transaction should be kept waiting to determine whether the transaction unexpectedly crashed. The value should be in hours. If there are some transactions in the event-store that have been shared for replaying but even after 12-hours (configured time,) that transaction has not been retried with that token. This is a very rare case. For instance, after receiving the transaction for replaying by the one of available instances, the instance goes down due to a power cut without executing the transaction. But the leader has been updated as the transaction has been shared to an instance for doing replay. Due to that, the leader doesn't invoke those transactions again until the transaction is updated by the received instance or the `crashedTransactionRestoreRetentionHours` is exceeded. Before collecting the transactions that should be retried, the leader checks that if there are some transactions that exceed the `crashedTransactionRestoreRetentionHours` time and those transactions update again as to be eligible for retrying.
|`stacksaga.cloud.transactionRetryRetentionPeriod` | 60 * 10  | Duration by | How many times should a transaction be retried within a certain period of time?
|`stacksaga.cloud.transactionRetryBatchSize` | 5000  | long | When the leader fetches the transactions from the event-store that should be replayed, how much should be the batch size. For instance, If there are 100_000 transactions on the event-store to be replayed, those 100_000 transactions loaded in to the Transaction-Retry-Queue 20 times.
|`stacksaga.cloud.transactionRetryOrder` | ASC  | Enum | Which order the transactions should be replayed based on the transaction initiate time. By default, ascending order is usd. (First-in > First-out)
|`stacksaga.cloud.transactionRetryQueueCapacity` | 10_000  | int | When the transactions are collected from the event-store that should be retried, a loop is triggered until the transactions count zero that should be retried. The transactions are fetched as batches for retrying, and those batches are added to the transaction queue for share those transactions to the available instances. The maximum size of that pool is configured here.
