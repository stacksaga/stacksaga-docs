|`stacksaga.agent.keyspace` | `stacksaga_event_store`  | `String` |  The keyspace(Database) name of the event-store.
|`stacksaga.agent.target-service-host` | -  | `String` |  The host name of the target service that retry tasks should be submitted to.
|`stacksaga.agent.target-service` | -  | `String` |  The name of the target service. (The transactions are fetched based on this name from the event-store)
|`stacksaga.agent.act-master-as-slave` | `true`  | `boolean` |  Whether the master service acts as the slave or not. If the cluster is small, you can run one instance and run as the master and as well as the slave.

|`stacksaga.agent.retry-initial-delay` | `60000(ms)`  | `long` | how long to wait before retrying the transaction at the beginning of the application.
|`stacksaga.agent.retry-fixed-rate` | `60000(ms)`  | `long` | the fixed rate for retrying the transaction. as per the default value, the transaction retry process is repeated every 60 seconds. *The executions are not overlapped even the old execution exceeds the interval*
