= StackSaga Database Support

Stacksaga database support is a separate dependency(Module) that provides all the facilities for accessing the respective databases for the Stacksaga engine.
As per the stacksaga architecture, it can be used the same database used by the orchestrator service.
Therefore, the database that supports for the Stacksaga engine depends on the primary database of the orchestrator service.
For instance, if Mysql database is used as the primary database of the orchestrator service, then the database support module should be `stacksaga-mysql-support`. Likewise, the following database support implementations are available currently.

. xref:framework:db-support/stacksaga-mysql-support.adoc[stacksaga-mysql-support] — Database support for Mysql
. xref:db-support/stacksaga-cassandra-support.adoc[stacksaga-cassandra-support] — Database support for Cassandra
