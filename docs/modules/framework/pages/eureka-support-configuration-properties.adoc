= StackSaga agent Configuration Properties

Stacksaga MYSQL agent does support both eureka based and kubernetes based environments.
There is a list of xref:common_configuration_properties[common configuration properties] for both and as well as there are some configuration properties specific to xref:specific_to_eureka[eureka] and xref:specific_to_kubernetes[kubernetes].

[[specific_to_eureka]]
== Eureka profile's Configuration Properties

If you are in the Eureka environment, then you have to configure the following configuration properties.

[cols="~,~,~,70h"]
|===
|Property Name|Default Value|Type|Description
|`stacksaga.agent.eureka.instance-type`|-|`InstanceType`[Enum]|The type of this agent. Whether this agent is master or slave. in the cluster, it should have at least one master node.
|`stacksaga.agent.eureka.token-range-update-delay`|-|`300000`| if the instance is a master instance, the delay time to update the token range. (Master will send the token range to the slave agent in withing this delay time.)
|`stacksaga.agent.eureka.token-range-update-initial-delay`|-|`300000`| if the instance is a master instance, the initial delay for updating the token range by the master.
|`stacksaga.agent.eureka.token-range-valid-duration`|-|`420000`| How long time the token range should be valid. This valid time is sent to the slave instance, and its executions are based on this time. The default value is tokenRangeUpdateDelay + 2 minutes = 7 minutes. The extra 5 minutes are added to avoid the network delay. The tokenRangeValidDuration should be greater than tokenRangeUpdateDelay all the time.
