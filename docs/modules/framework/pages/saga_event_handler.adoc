= Saga Execution Event Listener  [[saga_event_handler]]

`SagaExecutionEventListener` is the place where you're notified about each and every action during the process by the SEC.
As an example, you hand over your transaction to the StackSaga engine by mentioning the starting executor.
After handing over, the engine will invoke your executors one by one.
During the process, the engine does provide some events regarding the execution to notify.
To get notified, you can create a separate EventListener classes for each and every <<creating_aggregator_class,Aggregator>>.
For creating the EventListeners, the EventListeners should be implemented from `ExecutionEventListener<A>` interface.
`A` is the Aggregator class that you want to get notified.
And also the class should be annotated with `*@SagaExecutionEventListener*`  or `@*SagaAsyncExecutionEventListener*`.
Those annotations provide Spring bean capabilities for your implementation as well.

NOTE: If you want to call the event methods in *Async-mode*  inside the handler, the handler class can be annotated with `@SagaAsyncExecutionEventListener` instead of `@SagaExecutionEventListener`.
Then it will run the event methods in separate threads asynchronously.

WARNING: Make sure to not use spring `@Async` annotation with each method inside the listener or the entire class.
Because StackSaga does create a separate thread pool for executing the event methods and also, you can customize it as per the requirements.

`ExecutionEventListener<A>` provides the following events to be notified.

. `*onEachProcessPerformed*`
- This method will be invoked after executing each sub process successfully.
â€” Just think about our example.
After payment process success, the order status should be updated as payment successful and also after successfully dispatched the order, the order status should be updated as order dispatched.
And just think, you want to update your customer by sending an email after the payment process and after dispatching the process.
Handler is the place that you can invoke your processes.

. `*onEachRevertPerformed*`
- This is the opposite of the onEachProcess.
That works after every successful process.
If the whole transaction has to be reverted at some point, the compensation process starts from that point.
Then the revert method of each executed executor starts to be executed as the compensations.
If you want to get notified after each compensation, onEachRevert method will be invoked by the framework with all the data that you want. +
According to the example, if the payment process is failed, you have to update the order status as payment failed.
This kind of execution can be proceeded in this method.
. `*onTransactionCompleted*`
- There are two meanings of transaction-complete.
One is that the transaction was processed without any process exception.
When considering the example the create-order success, user checking is successful, make payment is success, increase point is success, and finally dispatching the order is also success.
The 2nd success is, a process exception was happened and after that all the relevant compensation has been processed successfully.
(That means a revert error hasn't been occurred while the compensation process) otherwise we can say the compensation has been processed smoothly without any exceptions.
. `*onProcessException*`
- This is not relevant to the sub process.
That means the process exception can be happened only one time in the entire process.
When considering the example, you are going to dispatch the order, and it is failed because of non-retryable exception.
(Just think the order is not existing in the database) then the compensation process will be started.
This is the turning point to compensation start.
At that time, this method will be invoked by the framework with the data that you want.
. `*onTransactionTerminated*`
- According to the flow, any revert process can't have non-retryable exception.
That is the rule.
But sometimes the programmer may haven't been handled that.
Then the revert process also can't be processed anymore.
Then the framework marks that transaction as a garbage transaction and terminates the process.
This is a very rare case.
But it can be happened.

TIP: In `ExecutionEventListener`, all the abstract methods are default.
Therefore, you don't want to override all the methods, and you can only override the methods that you want as per the requirement.
And also you can create multiple listeners for the target Aggregator.

Here you can see an example how you can create a listener of `ExecutionEventListener`.
