=== @SagaException Annotation  [[saga_exception_annotation]]

If you want to throw an exception as a <<non_retryable_executor_exception,NonRetryableExecutorException>>, The framework suggests you to create a new exception for that by warping the real exception and specially that can be annotated with `@SagaException` annotation like below.

IMPORTANT: Make sure to don't add the variables for exception metadata in your new exception class.
Keep the exception class clear.
Because, the framework does provide another way to provide the metadata in <<stacksaga_exception_wrapping,NonRetryableExecutorException>>

[source,java]
----
@SagaException(name = "UserInactiveException") //<1>
public class UserInactiveException extends RuntimeException {
    //for just throw an exception.
    public UserInactiveException() {
    }

    //for just throw an exception with message.
    public UserInactiveException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }

    //for wrapping the exception.
    public UserInactiveException(String message, Throwable cause) {
        super(message, cause);
    }
}

<1> According to the <<usage_of_exceptions,usage of exceptions example>>, you can see this exception is used to throw if the user is inactive.
And also if you think the package of the exception class will be changed in some cases in the future, you can set a fixed name for the exception.
By annotating `@SagaException`.

At the first glance, you might think that there is no point in annotating by `@SagaException` when it is thrown.
However, it is important when it is used in the revert executions (revert execution of the <<command_executor,command executors>> or <<revert_after_executor,revert after>> or <<revert_before_executor,revert before>>).
As you know, the revert process goes through revert method of each and every <<command_executor,command executors>> that successfully executed in the past regarding the transaction.
Then you have to check what is the real exception that was thrown, and what is the metadata that you want to make the decisions.
As an example, just imagine that there is an event in the event-store to be executed.
While the event is in the event-store, a new version is released of the particular service.
And also the exception class has been moved to another package by mistake, or as a requirement.
But while then, the old event is trying to be invoked through the StackSaga engine with old data.
However, At this moment the exception class that caused the exception does not exist in the path when the exception was thrown initially.

you can use the following methods that `NonRetryableExecutorException` does provide for checking the exception in the revert process.

. `getRealExceptionName()`: Get the name with the path of the exception class that was thrown.
(This name is provided by the framework when the exception is thrown).
. `getRealExceptionSimpleName()`: Get just the name of the exception class that was thrown.
(This name is provided by the framework when the exception is thrown).
. `*getRealSagaExceptionName()*`: Get the name that has been given with `@SagaException` annotation.

NOTE: You can get the `Real Saga Exception Name` only if you have annotated with `@SagaException` annotation.

Here you can see an example of how you can use `SagaException` in the revert process.

@SagaExecutor(
        executeFor = "stock-management-service",
        liveCheck = true,
        value = "UpdateStockExecutor"

    @Override
    public ProcessStepManager<PlaceOrderAggregator> doProcess(
            ProcessStack processStack,
            PlaceOrderAggregator aggregator,
            ProcessStepManagerUtil<PlaceOrderAggregator> stepManager
    ) throws RetryableExecutorException, NonRetryableExecutorException {
        ...
    }

    @Override
    public void doRevert(
            ProcessStack previousProcessStack,
            NonRetryableExecutorException realException,
            PlaceOrderAggregator finalAggregatorState,
            RevertHintStore revertHintStore
    ) throws RetryableExecutorException {

        realException.getRealSagaExceptionName().ifPresent(realSagaExceptionName -> {// <1>
            if (realSagaExceptionName.equals("UserInactiveException")) {// <2>
                // <3>
                realException.get("reason").ifPresent(reason -> {
                    if (reason.equalsIgnoreCase("BadRequest")) {
                        //do the revert process
                    }
                });
            }
        });
    }
}

<1> You can get the `RealSagaExceptionName` by calling `getRealSagaExceptionName()` method.
And if you have annotated the exception class with `@SagaException` annotation when the exception was thrown, it will return a `Optional<String>` object with the name that has been mentioned in the `@SagaException` annotation.
Or otherwise, the object will be empty.
<2> check the equality of Saga exception name with the exception that you want.
<3> due to that, the exception is the exact same, you can get and check the metadata of the exception that you have given at the moment the exception was thrown.
