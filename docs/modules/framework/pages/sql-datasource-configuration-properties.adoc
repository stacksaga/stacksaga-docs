*NOTE:* Due to StackSaga internally uses HikariCP for managing the connection pool, all other regular configurations can be done according the https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP?tab=readme-ov-file#gear-configuration-knobs-baby[HikariCP Configurations] like username, password, connectionTimeout etc. +
The prefix is `stacksaga.datasource`

|`stacksaga.mysql.datasource.retry.crashed-restore-retention-period` | `3600`  | long | How long the transaction should be kept waiting to determine whether the transaction unexpectedly crashed.

|`stacksaga.mysql.datasource.retry.retention-period` | `300`  | long | How long the transaction should be kept waiting to next expose the transaction for retrying.
