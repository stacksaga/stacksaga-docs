= Saga Orchestrator Engines

== Overview

In the StackSaga ecosystem, the Saga Orchestrator Engines are the heart of the platform.
They are the components responsible for coordinating distributed transactions across microservices by executing Saga workflows â€” sequences of local transactions and their compensating actions â€” to maintain eventual consistency.

The available Saga Orchestrator Engine's implementations as follows,

* xref:implementations:stacksaga-sync/overview.adoc[]
* xref:implementations:stacksaga-kafka/overview.adoc[]

== How do Orchestrator Engines fit into the StackSaga ecosystem?

StackSaga is more than just the orchestrators â€” itâ€™s a full ecosystem.

* The Orchestrator Engines run your workflows.

* The Event Sourcing Layer records every step and outcome (so you can retry or trace).

* The Database Support Modules allow you to use your existing primary DB as the event store â€” no separate storage required.

* The Environment Integrations (Eureka, Kubernetes, etc.) ensure the orchestrators work in cloud-native deployments.

* The Transaction Tracing Dashboard visualizes all workflows and lets you manually intervene (retry, cancel, inspect).

ðŸ“Œ In short: Orchestrator Engines are the core execution brain inside a larger operational ecosystem.

== Key Responsibilities of StackSaga Orchestrator Engines

* Define & Execute Saga Flows â€“ Know the order of steps, call the right services, and handle branching logic.
* Manage Failures & Compensations â€“ If a step fails, trigger the defined rollback logic for previous steps.
* Persist Saga State â€“ Log every event (start, success, fail, retry) via the event-sourcing system.
* Support Retrying & Replay â€“ Recover from transient failures or manually restart failed workflows.
* Expose Status for Monitoring â€“ Feed data to the StackSaga Dashboard for real-time transaction tracing.
