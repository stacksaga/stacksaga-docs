IMPORTANT: It's recommended to read xref:ROOT:SEC.adoc[] to have a better common understanding of orchestration engine in Stacksaga.

Stacksaga-Sync Engine is a reactive Saga orchestration engine framework built on top of Spring Boot.

It enables developers to design and manage complex workflows by coordinating primary executions and their compensating actions, effectively addressing eventual consistency challenges in distributed systems through the Saga design pattern.

The Stacksaga-Sync Engine architecture supports implementing any synchronous communication style you choose — such as REST (over HTTP), gRPC (over HTTP/2), or GraphQL (over HTTP) — giving you the flexibility to integrate microservices using the most appropriate approach for your system’s needs.

And also you can see here some of the major features that StackSaga provides.

NOTE: Even though Stacksaga-Sync Engine runs reactively under the hood, it is fully compatible with both *reactive* and *non-reactive* Spring environments.

* Saga Orchestration engine for managing primary and compensating work flows.
* Transaction Coordination
* Idempotency (Ensures that repeating the same operation multiple times has the same effect as performing it once, which is crucial for reliability.)
* Transactions Asynchronous-Retrying
* Event sourcing (State Management)
* Monitoring Distributed transaction tracing via the StackSaga xref:trace-window:stacksaga-trace-window.adoc[Trace-Window].
* Concurrency Control and, many more…
