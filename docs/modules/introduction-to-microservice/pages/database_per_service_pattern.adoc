One of the benefits of microservice architecture is that it lets us choose the technology stack per service.
For instance, we can decide to use a relational database for service A and opt for a NoSQL database for service B. This model lets the services manage domain data independently on a data store that best suites its data types and schema.
Further, it also lets the service scale its datastore on-demand and insulates it from the failures of other services.
However, at times a transaction can span across multiple services, and ensuring data consistency across the service database is a challenge.
In the next section, let us examine the challenge of distributed transaction management with an example.
