To demonstrate the use of distributed transactions, weâ€™ll take an example of an e-commerce application that processes online orders and is implemented with microservice architecture.
There is a microservice to create the orders, one that processes the payment, another that updates the inventory and the last one that delivers the order.
Each of these microservices performs a local transaction to implement the individual functionalities:

To ensure a successful order processing service, all four microservices must complete the individual local transactions. If any of the microservice fails to complete its local transaction, all the completed preceding transactions should roll back to ensure data integrity. This is an example of a distributed transaction as the transaction boundary crosses multiple services and databases.
