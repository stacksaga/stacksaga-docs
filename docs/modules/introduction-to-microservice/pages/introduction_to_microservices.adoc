= Introduction To Microservices

In this section, you will get the architecture of this framework.
Other than that, you will get what are the limitations you have to face when you are going to use microservice architecture and how overcome those difficulties by using StackSAGA framework.

== Microservice Architecture

Before dive in to the framework, let's have the basic idea of microservice architecture.
A microservice' architecture consists of a collection of small, autonomous services.
Each service is self-contained and should implement a single business capability within a bounded context.
A bounded context is a natural division within a business and provides an explicit boundary within which a domain model exists.

=== What are microservices?

Microservices are a modern approach to software whereby application code is delivered in small, manageable pieces, independent of others.

== Database per Service Pattern

One of the benefits of microservice architecture is that it lets us choose the technology stack per service.
For instance, we can decide to use a relational database for service A and opt for a NoSQL database for service B. This model lets the services manage domain data independently on a data store that best suites its data types and schema.
Further, it also lets the service scale its datastore on-demand and insulates it from the failures of other services.
However, at times a transaction can span across multiple services, and ensuring data consistency across the service database is a challenge.
In the next section, let us examine the challenge of distributed transaction management with an example.

== Distributed Transaction

To demonstrate the use of distributed transactions, weâ€™ll take an example of an e-commerce application that processes online orders and is implemented with microservice architecture.
There is a microservice to create the orders, one that processes the payment, another that updates the inventory and the last one that delivers the order.
Each of these microservices performs a local transaction to implement the individual functionalities:

To ensure a successful order processing service, all four microservices must complete the individual local transactions. If any of the microservice fails to complete its local transaction, all the completed preceding transactions should roll back to ensure data integrity. This is an example of a distributed transaction as the transaction boundary crosses multiple services and databases.
