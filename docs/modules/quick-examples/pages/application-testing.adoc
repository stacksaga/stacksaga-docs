== Testing

TIP: After running all the services, if you want to test all the endpoints, go and test your endpoints https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10011188/2sA3JNc1NB[here] with your Postman.

Let's make a request for placing an order.

The place order process testing is done in three ways.

. xref:application-testing.adoc#fully_successful_transaction_testing[Fully successful transaction]
. xref:application-testing.adoc#revert_success_transaction[Revert successful transaction]
. xref:application-testing.adoc#revert_failed_transaction[Revert failed transaction]

IMPORTANT: Even though we are simulating xref:architecture:stack_saga_transaction_type.adoc#revert_failed_transaction_scenario[Revert failed transaction] in this demo, Make sure not to happen a compensation failure.

[[fully_successful_transaction_testing]]
=== Fully successful transaction Testing

Let's see by making a request that can be fulfilled the entire process successfully.

The user1 has enough money in his wallet.
And also the stocks are available, and all the utility services are working well.
So our request's all primary executions should be successful as we expect.

You can see here as we expected, the transaction has been invoked through all the executors successfully.

After making the request, you will have a response like below.
You can see the `order_id` has been created successfully.
Now let's move to the admin dashboard and see the trace of the transaction.
Go to the tracing menu and find your transaction tracing data by providing the `transaction id` that stacksaga generated.
)

IMPORTANT: If you didn't test your order-service connectivity through the `Service Connector` window, make sure to go and xref:admin:stacksaga_admin.adoc#validate_your_connectivity[validate your connectivity] by providing target *root URL* and *service-name* (Or Aliased name).

.*Summary Of the transaction*
image:stacksaga-place-order-api-test-tracing-summary.png[]

*Highlights*

* In this section, you can see all the things regarding the transaction like transaction data,current status, whether it has some exception or not., what is the instance that transaction was executed, region and zone etc.

.*Execution Summary of the transaction*
image:stacksaga-place-order-api-test-executor-summary.png[]

*Highlights*

* In this section, you can see all the executors that were executed one by one.
Ant the time they were executed, and how long each executor has spent to execute.

By clicking each executor, you will be able to see each executor in detail like how the aggregator updated and how many times the executor was executed, etc.

.*INIExecutorDefault*
image:stacksaga-demo-executor-1.png[]

*Highlights*

* Any transaction in StackSaga has initial executor details, and it shows the initial state of the aggregator.
(If the executor is INIExecutorDefault one all the time, the entered aggregator snapshot and modified aggregator snapshot are the same).
* We can see the initial data that we updated from the xref://[OrderController] class.
And the rest of the data will be updated on the next executors.
In addition to that, there are two properties called `aggregatorTransactionId` and `initializedVersion`.
You know the `aggregatorTransactionId` is updated after handing over the execution to the xref://[SEC].
The `initializedVersion` is provided what was the version of the aggregator (The version that you mention at `@SagaAggregator` in your Custom Aggregator) when the transaction is started.
This will help to make the decisions when update your aggregator in the feature.
See  xref:architecture:version_casting_architecture.adoc[Aggregator Casting] ]

__As we navigated in the controller, the next executor should be `UserDetailExecutor`.__

.*UserDetailExecutor Aggregator State*
image:stacksaga-demo-executor-2.png[]

*Highlights*

* The entered aggregator state is the one that came to the executor after the last execution.
Therefore, the `delivery_details` is `null` and `executions` list has only one data.
And on the right side, you can see the modified aggregator state after executing the `UserDetailExecutor`.
There you can see the `delivery_details` was updated, and the name of the executor was added to the `executions` list (The 2nd one) due to the UserDetailExecutor has been executed successfully.

_As we navigated in the `UserDetailExecutor`, the next executor should be `OrderInitializeExecutor`._

.*OrderInitializeExecutor Aggregator State*
image:stacksaga-demo-executor-3.png[]

*Highlights*

* The entered state of the aggregator is equal to the modified aggregator state of the last executor called `UserDetailExecutor`.
And after executing the `OrderInitializeExecutor`, the name of the executor was added to the `executions` list (The 3rd one).

_As we navigated in the `OrderInitializeExecutor`, the next executor should be `PreAuthExecutor`._

.*PreAuthExecutor Aggregator State*
image:stacksaga-demo-executor-4.png[]

*Highlights*

* The entered state of the aggregator is equal to the modified aggregator state of the last executor called `OrderInitializeExecutor`.
And after successfully executing the `PreAuthExecutor` you can see that the `pre_auth_ref` was updated at the modified aggregator state.
And the name of the executor was added to the `executions` list (The 4th one)

_As we navigated in the `PreAuthExecutor`, the next executor should be `StockUpdateExecutor`._

.*StockUpdateExecutor Aggregator State*
image:stacksaga-demo-executor-5.png[]

* The entered state of the aggregator is equal to the modified aggregator state of the last executor called `PreAuthExecutor`.
And after successfully executing the `StockUpdateExecutor` you can see that the name of the executor was added to the `executions` list (The 5th one).

_As we navigated in the `StockUpdateExecutor`, the next executor should be `MakePaymentExecutor`._

.*MakePaymentExecutor Aggregator State*
image:stacksaga-demo-executor-6.png[]

* The entered state of the aggregator is equal to the modified aggregator state of the last executor called `StockUpdateExecutor`.
And after successfully executing the `MakePaymentExecutor` you can see that the `payment_id` was updated.
And name of the executor was added to the `executions` list (The 6th one).

[[revert_success_transaction]]
=== Revert Success Transaction

Let's look at such a scenario one of primary executions is fielded with non-retryable exception.
You can remember that in the `PreAuthExecutor` we caught the `FORBIDDEN` exception that sends by the `payment-service`
if the user's wallet has no balance to make the pre-auth.
In this testing, let's place an order with a higher amount than the wallet has.
