=== Creating MakePaymentExecutor (Command-Executor)

`MakePaymentExecutor` is the final executor as per the usecase.
This executor interacts with the utility `payment-service`.
In the `PreAuthExecutor` also access the utility `payment-service` for making the pre-auth.
The executor is responsible for making the real payment.

// <1>
@SagaExecutor(executeFor = "stock-service", liveCheck = false, value = "StockUpdateExecutor")
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class MakePaymentExecutor implements CommandExecutor<PlaceOrderAggregator> { // <2>

    private final PaymentService paymentService; // <3>
    @Override
    public ProcessStepManager<PlaceOrderAggregator> doProcess(PlaceOrderAggregator currentAggregator, ProcessStepManagerUtil<PlaceOrderAggregator> stepManager, String idempotencyKey) throws RetryableExecutorException, NonRetryableExecutorException {
        // <4>
        currentAggregator.getExecutions().add(this.getClass().getSimpleName() + ":" + LocalDateTime.now());
        // <5>
        String paymentId = this.paymentService.makePayment(
                MakePaymentDto
                        .RequestBody
                        .builder()
                        .amount(currentAggregator.getAmount())
                        .pareAuthRef(currentAggregator.getPreAuthRef())
                        .userId(currentAggregator.getUserId())
                        .build()
        );
        // <6>
        currentAggregator.setPaymentId(paymentId);
        return stepManager.complete(OrderStatus.MADE_PAYMENT);// <7>
    }

    @Override
    public String doRevert(NonRetryableExecutorException processException, PlaceOrderAggregator finalAggregatorState, RevertHintStore revertHintStore) throws RetryableExecutorException {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException(); // <8>
    }
}

*Highlights*

<1> Annotate the `MakePaymentExecutor` class as a `SagaExecutor` by using `@SagaExecutor` annotation.
executeFor:: executeFor is the target serviceâ€™s name.

value:: value is the bean name of the executor.
<2> Implement the `MakePaymentExecutor` from the `CommandExecutor` by passing the target Aggregator.

<3> Autowire the `PaymentService`.
The old payment service is used this as well.
(The new methods will be updated below.)
+
TIP: The relationship between the executor and service should not be one-to-one.
A service can be used by many executors.
In this example, the PaymentService class is used for PreAuthExecutor both executors.

<4> Calling the PaymentService's `makePayment()` method for making the payment.
To make the payment, we have to pass the following data.
+

-`amount`:: initialized at `OrderController`
-`pareAuthRef`:: initialized at `PreAuthExecutor`
-`userId`:: initialized at `OrderController`

<5> Updates the payment in the `currentAggregator`.

<6> Due to this step is the finale execution, mentions the *compiled* signal to the SEC by using `stepManager.complete` method with the status as `MADE_PAYMENT`.
By mentioning *compiled* signal, the SEC stop the execution and mark the transaction has been successfully completed.

<7> All other command-executors had a Compensating but in this executor have no any execution for Compensating at this moment.
The reason is that this is the final execution of this entire process and there is no any next executor can be failed.
You know that all the revert executions are called as the descending order from where the `NonRetryableExecutorException` is thrown.
Even this execution is failed for some reason, no need to do a Compensating because that execution already failed.
If this execution failed for some reason, all other executed (successfully executed so far), executor's Compensatings should be invoked.
+
IMPORTANT: If you add another execution after making the Payment, you must implement the `doRevert()` method.
Because that new execution is failed for some reason, the payment should be refunded.
Because the payment is already done.

=== Updating the PaymentService.

To make the payment, we have to create a new method in the existing `PaymentService`.

[source,java]
----
    public String makePayment(MakePaymentDto.RequestBody requestBody) throws RetryableExecutorException, NonRetryableExecutorException {
        try {
            MakePaymentDto.ResponseBody responseBody = this.restTemplate.postForObject(
                    "http://payment-service/pay",
                    requestBody,
                    MakePaymentDto.ResponseBody.class
            );
            assert responseBody != null;
            log.debug(responseBody.getMessage());
            return responseBody.getPaymentRef();
        } catch (HttpClientErrorException ex) {
            // This exception is thrown for HTTP 4xx errors (Client errors)
            // You can handle specific HTTP error codes here
            throw ex;
        } catch (HttpServerErrorException ex) {
            // This exception is thrown for HTTP 5xx errors (Server errors)
            // You can handle specific HTTP error codes here
            if (ex.getStatusCode().equals(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)) {
                throw ex;
            } else {
                //502 , 503, 504, 509 etc.
                throw RetryableExecutorException.buildWith(ex).build();
            }
        } catch (RestClientException ex) {
            // This exception is a generic RestClientException
            // Handle other types of exceptions here
            throw ex;
        } catch (IllegalArgumentException illegalArgumentException) {
            throw RetryableExecutorException.buildWith(illegalArgumentException).build();
        }
    }

That method is also pretty much the same as the service methods we have been implementing so far.
Just call the target utility service and handle the exception.
