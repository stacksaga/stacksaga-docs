=== Creating OrderController (API Endpoint).

As per the diagram, you know that the request comes to the `/order/place` endpoint and also the handing over the execution to the stacksaga is happened in this controller class.

[source,java]

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/order")
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class OrderController {

    // <1>
    private final SagaTemplate<PlaceOrderAggregator> placeOrderAggregatorSagaTemplate;

    @PostMapping("/place")
    @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.ACCEPTED)
    public PlaceOrderDto.ResponseBody createOrder(@RequestBody PlaceOrderDto.RequestBody requestBody) {

        // <2>
        final PlaceOrderAggregator placeOrderAggregator = new PlaceOrderAggregator();
        placeOrderAggregator.setUserId(requestBody.getUserId());
        placeOrderAggregator.setItems(requestBody.getItems());
        // <3>
        placeOrderAggregatorSagaTemplate.process(
                placeOrderAggregator,
                OrderInitializeExecutor.class
        );
        // <4>
        return PlaceOrderDto.ResponseBody.builder()
                .orderId(placeOrderAggregator.getAggregatorTransactionId())
                .message("order has been submitted successfully")
                .build();
    }
}

<1> Autowire the xref:framework:saga_template.adoc[SagaTemplate] for handing over the execution to the framework.
Your target aggregator class should be provided to the `SagaTemplate` as a type.
<2> Initialize the xref:quick-examples:creating-aggregator.adoc[PlaceOrderAggregator]  [https://github.com/stacksaga/stacksaga-examples/blob/main/stacksaga-demo-for-kubernetes/order-service/src/main/java/org/example/aggregator/PlaceOrderAggregator.java[icon:github[role=black]]] and set the data that should be added initially.
In our case, the necessary data that are given from the endpoint are added to the aggregator object.
You can see the initialized data at the dashboard xref://[like this].
<3> Handing over the execution to the framework.
From here the execution will be handled by the StackSaga execution coordinator xref://[(SEC)] asynchronously.

<4> Build the response object to the client by using the `aggregatorTransactionId`.
`aggregatorTransactionId` can access through your aggregator object due to that id comes from the `Aggregator` super.
