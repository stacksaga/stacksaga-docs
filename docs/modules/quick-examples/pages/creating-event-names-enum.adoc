=== Creating SagaExecutionEventName Implementation (OrderStatus Enum)

All the executions can have an event-name based on the action like topic in kafka.
It is used for identifying the actions in the dashboard.
As an example after making the payment, you can indicate to the SEC the event as `MADE_PAYMENT`.
In StackSaga framework you can create an enum class by implementing from the `SagaExecutionEventName` interface.
For our upcoming executors, the following event names will be used.

    RELEASED_PRE_AUTH,
    UPDATED_STOCK,
