====  Creating executors

You know that we have to access more services except this `order-service` to fully complete the place-order request.
To access those services in general, you would use *service-layer* and call those services by using any httpclient like RestTemplate, Feign client, Okhttp, and so on.
But in the xref://[Saga design pattern], you know that we should have a compensation process for all the execution (All the executions that make some changes in a database).
Due to the fact that the StackSaga framework is one of Saga implementations, it should be provided the main execution and also a compensation execution to make a compensation when the entire process is failed at any point.

> Read the xref://[reference documentation]
to have a better understanding and best practices regarding the `SagaExecutors`.

StackSaga doesn't bother to that layer.
In StackSaga, In addition to that layer you have to implement a new layer called `*executor-layer*`.
In the executor-layer, you can create your executors.

All the *process-executions* (The regular execution to make the process) and *revert-executions* (The compensation executions to undo the made changes by process-executions) with the relevant services are summarized in the following table.
