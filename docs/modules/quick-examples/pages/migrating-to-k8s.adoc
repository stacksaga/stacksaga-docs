:description: StackSaga Quick Start With Kubernetes

== Overview

In this section, we are going to see how to deploy the xref:quick-examples:stacksaga-demo.adoc[developed system] in the kubernetes environment.

NOTE: In the kubernetes environment, the eureka discovery service and the api-gateway are not used in most cases.
Because Kubernetes has the alternative and inbuilt solution for service-discovery and request routing and load-balancing.
In this deployment the eureka is replaced with the inbuilt solution called https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/[kubernetes-service,] and the API-Gateway is replaced by the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/[kubernetes-ingress].
The rest of services are remaining the same.
To run the same application in the kubernetes environment as well, all the applications have a profile called `k8s` for maven by adding the specific dependencies.
Therefore, mentioning the https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-profiles.html[profile] when applications are built.

== High-level implementation diagram with Kubernetes Flags.

by keeping the local environment's configurations, let's add new configurations for the kubernetes environment in separate profile called `k8s` and also create the manifest files.

NOTE: To reduce the unnecessary complexity, All the changes are not discovered one by one here, Only the xref:highlights[highlights] are discussed below.

== Run And Test

* Apply all the manifest files in to the kubernetes and make a request to the `order-service` via the ingress controller's IP address (Host).
+

* See the transaction tracing via the StackSaga Cloud-Window by connecting with the target orchestration service (`order-service`).

[[mixed_content_error]]
====

IMPORTANT: When the connection is tested via the StackSaga Cloud-Window, you will have `Mixed Content` error like below.

TIP: To avoid `Mixed Content` restriction, you can go the `flags` page of your browser and search *Insecure origins treated as secure* and then enter *Domain or IP* address with port, and choose Enabled like below.
It allows you to bypass `Mixed Content` restriction.

[[highlights]]
== Highlights

=== `mysql-server` highlights

* According to the example, To run all the applications, it is required to have a Mysql database.
Therefore, we deploy one single mysql-server in the kubernetes environment.
+
NOTE: Due to demo purposes, we use only one single database for all the services.
But in general, you can have multiple databases per service.
And make sure to use a managed database tn the production instead of managing the database server by yourself.

* To overcome the following advantages, `StatefulSet` is preferred over `Deployment` for MySQL. +

. Stable network identity
. Persistent storage per pod
. Ordered startup and shutdown
. Safe MySQL replication setup

=== `Ingress-controller` highlights

An Ingress controller is used instead of Spring Cloud API-Gateway here for mapping the requests.

=== `order-service` highlights

* Make sure to build the application by providing the profile called `k8s` for maven.
* `k8s` configuration profile is used for deploying the `order-service` in the kubernetes environment with a separate https://github.com/stacksaga/stacksaga-examples/blob/main/stacksaga-demo-default/order-service/src/main/resources/application-k8s.yaml[application-k8s.yaml].
* Due to `stacksaga-connect-k8s-support` connect with the `k8s` API, it has been provided the https://github.com/stacksaga/stacksaga-examples/blob/main/stacksaga-demo-default/deployment/k8s/order-service/ServiceAccount.yaml[service account]
and https://github.com/stacksaga/stacksaga-examples/blob/main/stacksaga-demo-default/deployment/k8s/order-service/ClusterRole.yaml[role] and https://github.com/stacksaga/stacksaga-examples/blob/main/stacksaga-demo-default/deployment/k8s/order-service/ClusterRoleBinding.yaml[role-binding] for the kubernetes API and bind the *service account* with the https://github.com/stacksaga/stacksaga-examples/blob/main/stacksaga-demo-default/deployment/k8s/order-service/Deployment.yaml#L15[deployment].
* A *context-path* is provided as `/order-service` for configuring the service with the ingress-controller conveniently.
* Other services' hosts are changed to the `k8s` environment's https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/[DNS].
