=== Updating Configuration Properties

We have all 4 utility services and also other 2 services called *api-gateway* and *eureka service* to configure.
But except the *order-service* and *api-gateway*, other services are regular spring-boot services.

Therefore, we are not going to deep diving to them.
You can see configuration properties through the following links.

.Configuration Properties for regular services.
* https://github.com/stacksaga/stacksaga-examples/tree/main/stacksaga-demo-default/user-service/src/main/resources[user-service]
* https://github.com/stacksaga/stacksaga-examples/tree/main/stacksaga-demo-default/stock-service/src/main/resources[stock-service]
* https://github.com/stacksaga/stacksaga-examples/tree/main/stacksaga-demo-default/payment-service/src/main/resources[payment-service]
* https://github.com/stacksaga/stacksaga-examples/tree/main/stacksaga-demo-default/eureka-service/src/main/resources[eureka-service]

Let's see how to configure The most important configuration properties in the *order-service* specially the configuration-properties of the StackSaga.

[source,yaml]

NOTE: Due to this approach is the default environment, you use the default profile.
When we move to other environments (xref:stackSaga-demo-with-docker-and-docker-compose.adoc[docker-compose] and xref:migrating-to-k8s.adoc[kubernetes]), different profiles will be created.

*Highlights*

<1> Due to we are using the eureka for service registry, the port is kept as zero and then the server will be started with a random port.

<2> set the eureka service url.

<3> set the unique random ID for each instance.

<4> The `spring.application.name` set as `order-service`.
+
The name of the application is most important for StackSaga.
Because the user is assigned to the specific application name for monitoring the transaction tracing details in the StackSaga Cloud-Window.
For instance, if you want to see the transaction details of the `order-service` in the StackSaga Cloud-Window, your account should have the privilege to see it.

<5> Datasource configurations for accessing the database of the `order-service`.

<6> Enable the StackSaga framework in the application.

<7> Application release version. xref:framework:core-configuration-properties.adoc#stacksaga-app-release-version[See more]

<8> We have to provide the packages to the framework where the `Aggregator` classes are located.
In our example, the package is `org.example.aggregator`.
If you have multiple locations, you can provide a list of packages.

<9> Datasource configurations for accessing the event-store database by the framework.


<10> Enable the in-built API by the StackSaga framework for accessing the event-store via the StackSaga Cloud-Window.

<11> Enable the security to protect the enabled API to access the data from the event-store.

<12> Due to enabling the api filtering, you have to provide an access-token that has been created by the StackSaga Cloud-Window to see the tracing details. xref:#[See how the token is created]

<13> due to stacksaga adding the `aggregator-id` in to *Mapped Diagnostic Context* (MDC) for monitoring the transaction log, you can update your logging pattern like this.
then you can easily identify all the logs regarding the specific transaction.
the output will be like this.
+
image:stacksaga-transaction-id-log-with-pattern.png[]
+
`SA-1717265615759-382463295016275` is the transaction id of that particular transaction.

====
NOTE: If you are using spring tracing implementation, you can keep the log pattern like this

[source,properties]
----
logging.pattern.level="%5p [${spring.application.name:},%X{traceId:-},%X{spanId:-},%X{aggregatorId:-}]"
