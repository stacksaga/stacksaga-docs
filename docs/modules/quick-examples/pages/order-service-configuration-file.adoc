=== Updating Configuration Properties

We have all 4 utility services and also other 2 services called api-gateway and eureka service to configure.
But except the order-service and api-gateway, other services are regular spring-cloud services.
Therefore, we are not going to deep diving to them.
You can see get the Configuration Properties through these links.

.Configuration Properties for regular services.
* xref://[user-service]
* xref://[stock-service]
* xref://[payment-service]
* xref://[eureka-service]

NOTE: The above links are related to the default deployment approach.
If you want
to see
how the applications are deployed
by using xref://[docker-compose] or xref:quick-examples:migrating-to-k8s.adoc[kubernetes],
reach these links.

Let's see how to configure The most important service called order-service.

[source,yaml]
.application.yaml
----
services:
  # <1>
  payment-service: http://payment-service
  stock-service: http://stock-service
  user-service: http://user-service
server:
  port: 8081
eureka:
  client:
    serviceUrl:
      # <2>
      defaultZone: http://localhost:8085/eureka/
  instance:
    hostname: localhost
    # <3>
    instance-id: ${spring.application.name}:${random.uuid}
spring:
  application:
    # <4>
    name: order-service
  datasource:
    username: root
    password: mafei
    driver-class-name: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/stacksaga_place_order_demo_order_service?createDatabaseIfNotExist=true
  liquibase:
    # <5>
    enabled: false
# <6>
stacksaga:
  enable: true # <7>
  component-scan: org.example.aggregator # <8>
  app-release-version: 1.0.0 # <9>
  connect:
    admin-urls:
      - http://localhost:4444 # <10>
    admin-username: order-service-application-user # <11>
    admin-password: ykLO89Irx2Q6Cf2j # <11>
  datasource:
    # <12>
    mysql:
      jdbc-url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/order-service?createDatabaseIfNotExist=true
      username: root
      password: mafei
      driver-class-name: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver

management:
  endpoint:
    env:
      enabled: true
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: "*"
info:
  app:
    author: mafei
    name: ${spring.application.name}
    version: ${stacksaga.app-release-version}
logging:
  pattern:
    # <13>
    level: "%5p [${spring.application.name:},%X{aggregatorId:-}]"

NOTE: Due to this approach is the default environment, you use the default profile.
When we move to other environments (xref:stackSaga-demo-with-docker-and-docker-compose.adoc[docker-compose] and xref:migrating-to-k8s.adoc[kubernetes]), different profiles will be created.

*Highlights*

<1> We decided to obtain the service's hosts that we use inside the order service from the configuration file.
Because the host nam will be different with other environments, (spring profiles) like xref:stackSaga-demo-with-docker-and-docker-compose.adoc[docker-compose] and xref:migrating-to-k8s.adoc[kubernetes].

<2> Due to we use xref://[Eureka service discovery], we have provided the URL of the eureka server.

<3> To identify the eureka client (the instance,) you have to provide a unique id for each instance.

<4> it is most important because the service-user account should be equal the `spring.application.name`.

<5> `spring.liquibase.enabled` Even if you haven't added `liquibase` in your application, StackSaga uses  `liquibase` internally.
Due to the `liquibase` dependency exists in the application spring tries to access the autoconfiguration.
Then you will get an error.
To avoid that exception, you have to disable it.
+
WARNING: If you want to use `liquibase` in your application you are free to use it as usual, and then you don't want to disable `liquibase` like above.

<6> The section that StackSaga configurations started.

<7> It is not enough to add the StackSaga dependencies.
To enable StackSaga, you have to enable StackSaga.

<8> We have to provide the packages to StackSaga where the `Aggregator` class are stored.
In our example the package is `org.example.aggregator`.
If you have multiple locations, you can provide a list of packages.

<9> This will be helpful to identify the metadata from the admin dashboard.
Because all the aggregator and executors metadata is saved under the `app-release-version`.
As an example, if you want to see what are the aggregators and executors that have been configured, you select the version and see them.

<10> The admin URL that the admin-server is running on.
If multiple xref://[admin-server] instances are running, you can provide all the list of URLs.
[[mentioning_service_user_credential]]
<11> The username and the password of the xref:admin:create_service_user.adoc[service-user] that you created for this `order-service`.

<12> You have to provide the datasource for the event-store that you use.
In this example we have used `stacksaga-mysql-support` dependency we have to provide the Mysql datasource configurations.

<13> due to stacksaga adding the aggregator id in to Mapped Diagnostic Context (MDC) for monitoring the transaction log, you can update your logging pattern like this.
then you can identify easily all the logs regarding the specific transaction.
the output will be like this.
+
image:stacksaga-transaction-id-log-with-pattern.png[]
+
`SA-1717265615759-382463295016275` is the transaction id of that particular transaction.

====
NOTE: If you are using spring tracing implementation, you can keep the log pattern like this

[source,shell]
----
%5p [${spring.application.name:},%X{traceId:-},%X{spanId:-},%X{aggregatorId:-}]
