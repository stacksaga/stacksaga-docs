*Road Map*

The first step of the deployment part is initializing the Admin Server And Dashboard and creating a service-user account for the order-service.

We are not going to show each step here because there is a clear guide at the reference document.
Please fallow these links.

* xref:admin:stacksaga_admin.adoc#admin_server_run[Initializing the Admin Server And Dashboard]
* xref:admin:stacksaga_admin.adoc#create_service_user[Creating a service-user account] for order-service.
Make sure to create the order-service user as `order-service-application-user`.
Because we have added the username in xref:order-service-configuration-file.adoc#mentioning_service_user_credential[application.yaml] file at the `order-service`.)
