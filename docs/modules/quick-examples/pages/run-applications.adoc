And also if you want to see all the instances, one by one, go to the page called *instances* and enter the service name, and then you will be able to see all the instances that you have run so far like below.

NOTE: If you are using eureka as the service registry, the instance id will be the eureka instance ID, and if you are in kubernetes cluster, the instance ID will be the Pod ID.
