:description: StackSaga Quick Start With Kubernetes

== Overview

In this demo, we are focusing on how to implement the StackSaga things in the spring boot in microservice architecture.

> IF you are new to StackSaga, it is recommitted to read the xref:architecture:aggregator.adoc[architecture] and xref:framework:create-aggregator.adoc[reference documentation]
for read individual components.

In this example, we have 4 utility microservices called `order-service`, `user-service`, `payment-service`, and `stock-service.` in addition to that,
https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-gateway[Spring Cloud Api Gateway] is used as the proxy server and as well as the Application Load Balancer (ALB).
and also Eureka Discovery is used for service registry.

The use-case is the clients can palace an order and then the order request should be completed go through these 4 services.

Each services' responsibilities as follows.

[horizontal]
`*order-service*`:: Order service is responsible for accepting the place order request and managing the entire transaction as the xref://[orchestrator].
and also as a utility service, the service is responsible for storing the order related specific data in the order-service database.
According to this us-case, This is the service that stacksaga is added.

`*user-service*`:: To make the process we want to have the user details like delivery address.
`user-service` managing the user-related data, and it provides endpoints to fetch the user's data.

`*payment-service*`:: In the placing order process, the utility `payment-service` involves to two main tasks.
+
. To make the *Pre-Auth* before doing the real transaction and to check that the payment can be done or not.
. To make the payment (Real transaction).
All the steps are done smoothly finally the reserved transaction should be made.
These endpoints are provided by the `payment-service`.

`*stock-service*`:: After making the pre-auth process, we should update the real stock.
`stock-service` is responsible for providing endpoints to update the real stock and restore the update.


All the services that we are going to build.

* api-cloud-gateway
* eureka-service
* utility servers
** order-service
** user-service
** stock-service
** payment-service

Additionally `stacksaga-admin-dashboard` is run monitoring the transactions.

> source code is available on //[Github].

This guide is divided into 3 sections for your convenience.

[1] xref:stacksaga-demo.adoc#implementation[Implementation]:: Guides for implementing all java classes. (focus the StackSaga concepts)
[2] xref:stacksaga-demo.adoc#deployment[Deployment]:: Guides for creating and connecting The API-gateway and eureka service with utility services with all the configurations.
[3] xref:stacksaga-demo.adoc#testing[Testing]:: Testing the application by running all the applications together.

=== High-level Implementation Diagram.

Here you can see what we are going to build in High-level.

* In the diagram, StackSaga icons image:stack-saga-icon.svg[width=20] are shown which parts StackSaga interact.
* Red lines are shown how the StackSaga Admin interacts with the process and the request-flow.
* Black lines are shown how the regular http requests are done.

[[implementation]]
== Implementation

As the first step, we are going to create the Orchestrator Service called `order-service`.

NOTE: Even if there are 4 utility services in the diagram, we mainly focus the order service only.
Other services are traditional spring boot services, and there is nothing to discuss. +
You can download the full source code from //here.

=== Create Order-Service (Orchestrator Service)

The `order-service` is little bit spacial than the other utility servers because the `order-service` is the responsible for managing the entire transaction here.
That's why it called as xref://[Orchestrator Service].
And the next reason is that StackSaga involves that kind of service in your entire system.
Selecting a service as an Orchestrator service or not depends on your rearmament.

====  Create order the project with spring initializer

Go to the https://start.spring.io/[spring initializer] and create your project with the following Dependencies.

* `spring-boot-starter-web`
* `spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client`
* `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`
* `mysql-connector-java`
* `spring-cloud-starter-loadbalancer`
* `lombok`

NOTE: Due to that we are using eureka for service registry, we can use `spring-cloud-starter-loadbalancer` for internal client side load balancing.
Due to we use just `RestTemplate` as the httpclient we have to annotate by `+@LoadBalanced+` annotation. +
[ xref://[RestTemplateConfig] ]

After creating your project, add the StackSaga dependencies in the dependencies section.
There are 3 dependencies to be added based on your implementation.

* You can add the `stacksaga-spring-boot-starter` dependency based on the spring version that you wish to use.
#In this example, we will be using spring2.X.#
Spring 2.X::
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.stacksaga</groupId>
  <artifactId>stacksaga-spring-boot-2-starter</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
----
Spring 3.X::
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.stacksaga</groupId>
  <artifactId>stacksaga-spring-boot-3-starter</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
----

* Due to the database has been selected as Mysql, you have to add `stacksaga-mysql-support` dependency.
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.stacksaga</groupId>
    <artifactId>stacksaga-mysql-support</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
----

* Due to we are going to Eureka as the discovery service, you have to add `stacksaga-connect-k8s-support` dependency.
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.stacksaga</groupId>
    <artifactId>stacksaga-connect-eureka-support</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
----

Finally, the `pom.xml` file will be like below.
