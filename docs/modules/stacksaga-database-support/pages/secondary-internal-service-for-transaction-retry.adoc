Within the module that `stacksaga-{impl_name}-api-servlet` or `stacksaga-{impl_name}-api-webflux`, it provides a secondary HTTP port dedicated to internal communication for transaction retries.
This port runs in the same application context as the main service but uses a separate connector, ensuring that retry requests from agent services are isolated from external traffic.

The endpoints on this secondary port are automatically created by the framework and are exclusively called by agent services to process retry transactions.
This design ensures that internal retry operations do not interfere with the main application traffic.

The basic configurations can be changed as you prefer via the properties file.
refer to the xref:stacksaga:stacksaga-database-support:{impl_name}-database-support/stacksaga-{impl_name}-support.adoc#stacksaga-retry-server-configurations[configuration properties] table for more details.

Further customizations like changing the protocol (http/https), SSL configurations etc., developers can provide a customized https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/how-to/webserver.html#howto.webserver.configure[WebServerFactoryCustomizer<?>] through an implementation of `WebServerFactoryCustomizerSupplier` interface as a bean.
it will override the default customizer that is provided by the framework.
