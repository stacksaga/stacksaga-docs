= SagaTemplate [[saga_template]]

`SagaTemplate` is the class which is responsible for starting the StackSaga engine to invoke your transaction.
By providing the necessary data, you can say to start the process of the transaction for StackSaga engine.
`SagaTemplate` is an instance, and it provides one method called `process(...)` for starting the process.

NOTE: `SagaTemplate` Is a spring bean that you can Autowire (Injectable) in Spring environment.
You can autowire it by using spring @Autowire annotation or by creating the constructor.

        this.sagaTemplate.process(
                aggregator,

        return Collections.singletonMap(
                "order_id",

        );
    }

<1> Autowire(inject) the `SagaTemplate` by providing the target <<creating_aggregator_class,Aggregator>> Class.
<2> Initialize your aggregator by providing the initial data.
<3> Use the autowired `SagaTemplate` object and call the `process(..)` method.
As the first argument, you have to provide the initialized target aggregator object.
As the second argument you have to provide, which is the first executor that should be started the transaction.
According to the example, The 1st executor is `CheckUserExecutor.class`.
It can be either <<command_executor,Command-Executor>> or <<query_executor,Query-Executor>>.
<4> Returns the response by obtaining the aggregatorTransactionId from the initialized object.

NOTE: Due to the fact that the target aggregator class has been extended from the `Aggregator`, you can use inherited methods from `Aggregator` class.
The `getAggregatorTransactionId()` method is one of inherited methods from `Aggregator` class.
It will provide you the *unique ID* for each object (each transaction) that you initialize.
It will be the transaction id for the entire transaction.

'''

TIP: Even though `SagaTemplate<A>` can be autowired anywhere in the application, As the best practice it is recommended to use `SagaTemplate<A>` inside of an `EventHandler` class according to the StackSaga design pattern called <<test,CHES>>.
