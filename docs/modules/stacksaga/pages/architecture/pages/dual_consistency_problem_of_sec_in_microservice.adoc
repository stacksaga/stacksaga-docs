= Dual-Consistency problem of SEC in Saga. [[dual_consistency_problem_of_sec_in_microservice]]

== Introduction

In the microservice architecture, It is highly concerned about the data consistency.
As a result of that, you had to move in to the xref:introduction-to-stacksaga.adoc[SAGA design pattern,] and it ensures xref:saga-architecture.adoc#eventual_consistency[eventual consistency].

But the xref:SEC.adoc[SEC] also uses a database internally for storing the event data for retry purpose in StackSaga.
SEC is also another program that supports for invoking your executions as a middleware framework.
That means that all the execution data is saved in the database as events by the StackSaga framework before the real execution behind the scenes.

Because, in case your atomic transaction is failed for some reason, the atomic transaction should be rerun asynchronously.
To retry the transaction, the old state of the transaction that the transaction was stopped should be persisted in the event-store.

According to the above definition, when an atomic transaction of the long-running transaction is executed by the SEC, the SEC creates an additional atomic transaction in its event store.
However, since the SEC accesses the event store separately and has no control over the execution of the original atomic transaction, both transactions are executed independently.
If the SEC fails to save its data in the database after successfully executing the original atomic transaction of the long-running transaction, it can break the Atomicity rule.
This inconsistency arises due to the primary transaction is committed, but the SEC's state remains incomplete, leading to potential data integrity issues.

In brief, The responsibility of protecting both data-consistencies of internal event-store and your transactionâ€™s data-consistency is known as the Dual consistency problem of SEC.

read xref:stack_saga_transaction_type.adoc[this] for having a better understanding of how the SEC works.

== How StackSaga overcomes the Dual-Consistency Problem

////
Just imagine that Your entire domain (<<quick_understanding_example,place order example>>) can have 5 atomic transactions inside the <<executor_architecture,executors>>.
After calling the execution through the <<saga_template,`SagaTemplate`>>, StackSaga starts execution one by one as you configured order by the developer.
Then, before executing the transaction, the transaction should be initialized in the event-store.
In that case, StackSaga uses the event-store to store the event data at the 1st time in the transaction execution.
After successfully saving the initial event data, you will have a transaction id (<<creating_aggregator_class,aggregatorTransactionId>>).
And after that, your 1st executor will be executed by the SEC.
After executing your 1st atomic transaction, again the updated state is saved in the event-store by SEC.
Like so, all the time your state is saved in the event-store.
Then just think that after executing the 2nd atomic transaction (execution) SEC going to update the event-store and then an error is occurred due to connection issues of the event-store database.
////

Then the framework is failed to provide the data consistency by themselves of their side.
But the real fact, the first reason is for choosing a framework is to overcome the data consistency.
But If the framework is not capable of handling the data consistency by itself, there is no point in using a framework.

##In brief, The responsibility of protecting both data-consistency of internal event-store and your transaction's data-consistency is known as the Dual consistency problem of SEC.

Even though it is not possible technically to handle by the database side, StackSaga provides a best solution for that.
It is called as *Execution Chunk Protection Mechanism * in StackSaga.
