=== Create Service User [[create_service_user]]

// todo:check this aaccees correct or not.
Any Super admin user or admin user can create a `service-user-account` .
The `service-user-account` is little bit different from other accounts.
Because other accounts are related to the *user logins* but the `service-user-account` is created for *service logins* (service authentication).
And also it uses https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication#basic_authentication_scheme[Basic authentication] between the `utility-service` and the `admin-server`.

Step-1::
Go to the `users` menu, and move to the `registraion tab` and then select the user type as `ROLE_SERVICE` and enter the username and select the *primary service*.

WARNING: The primary service name should be the same of your spring boot application's name that you are going to use this credential.
If the system has no the target service, you can add it as a new one by clicking the + button.

TIP: It is recommended `*{service-name}-application-user*` format for creating the service-accounts.

Step-2::
After submitting the data you will have the `username` and a `generated password` (It is not temporary password and keep it in secret).
