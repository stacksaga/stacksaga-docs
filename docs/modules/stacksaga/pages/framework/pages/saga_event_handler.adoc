= Saga Execution Event Listener  [[saga_event_handler]]

`ExecutionEventListener<A>` is the place where you're notified about each and every action during the process by the SEC.
As an example, After handing over the transaction to the StackSaga engine by mentioning the starting executor, the engine will invoke your executors one by one.
During the process, the engine does provide some events regarding the execution to notify.
To get notified for each action, you can create a separate ExecutionEventListener implementations for xref:create-aggregator.adoc[Aggregators].
One aggregator can have many ExecutionEventListener implementations as needed.
Specially the ExecutionEventListener is provided for cross-cutting concerns.
therefore the implementations of the `ExecutionEventListener<A>` can be used in two ways.

* Synchronous way
- if the events also should be run in sequence order with the same thread, the Synchronous way can be implemented.
to overcome the Synchronous feature the implementation should be annotated by `*@SagaExecutionEventListener*`.
* Asynchronous way
- if the events should not be bothered to the man executions and if not required sequence order between real executions and events, the Asynchronous way can be implemented. and also the events are triggered in separate threads.
to overcome the Asynchronous feature the implementation should be annotated by `@*SagaAsyncExecutionEventListener*`.

NOTE: `ExecutionEventListener` comes with a generic parameter. the `<A>` is represented the target Aggregator. when the ExecutionEventListener implementation is created, the target aggregator should be mentioned. and also #the same aggregator is shared with the implementations, and it is not allowed to make any changes on the aggregator in the listeners according the StackSaga architecture.# you can only read the data from the aggregator.

//todo: add in image diagram about aggregator sharing across the threads

WARNING: Make sure to not use spring `@Async` annotation with each method inside the listener or the entire class.
Because StackSaga does create a separate thread pool for executing the event methods and also, you can customize it as per the requirements.

`ExecutionEventListener<A>` provides the following events to be notified.

[[onEachPrimaryExecutionPerformed]]
. `*onEachPrimaryExecutionPerformed*`
- This method will be invoked after executing each sub process successfully.
â€” Just think about our example.
After payment process success, the order status should be updated as payment successful and also after successfully dispatched the order, the order status should be updated as order dispatched.
And just think, you want to update your customer by sending an email after the payment process and after dispatching the process.
Handler is the place that you can invoke your processes.
[[onEachRevertPerformed]]
. `*onEachRevertPerformed*`
- This is the opposite of the onEachProcess.
That works after every successful process.
If the whole transaction has to be reverted at some point, the Compensating process starts from that point.
Then the revert method of each executed executor starts to be executed as the Compensatings.
If you want to get notified after each Compensating, onEachRevert method will be invoked by the framework with all the data that you want. +
According to the example, if the payment process is failed, you have to update the order status as payment failed.
This kind of execution can be proceeded in this method.
. `*onTransactionCompleted*`
- There are two meanings of transaction-complete.
One is that the transaction was processed without any process exception.
When considering the example the create-order success, user checking is successful, make payment is success, increase point is success, and finally dispatching the order is also success.
The 2nd success is, a process exception was happened and after that all the relevant Compensating has been processed successfully.
(That means a revert error hasn't been occurred while the Compensating process) otherwise we can say the Compensating has been processed smoothly without any exceptions.
[[onPrimaryExecutionException]]
. `*onPrimaryExecutionException*`
- This is not relevant to the sub process.
That means the process exception can be happened only one time in the entire process.
When considering the example, you are going to dispatch the order, and it is failed because of non-retryable exception.
(Just think the order is not existing in the database) then the Compensating process will be started.
This is the turning point to Compensating start.
At that time, this method will be invoked by the framework with the data that you want.
. `*onTransactionTerminated*`
- According to the flow, any revert process can't have non-retryable exception.
That is the rule.
But sometimes the programmer may haven't been handled that.
Then the revert process also can't be processed anymore.
Then the framework marks that transaction as a garbage transaction and terminates the process.
This is a very rare case.
But it can be happened.

TIP: In `ExecutionEventListener`, all the abstract methods are default.
Therefore, you don't want to override all the methods, and you can only override the methods that you want as per the requirement.
And also you can create multiple listeners for the target Aggregator.

Here you can see an example how you can create a listener of `ExecutionEventListener`.

NOTE: Other than this main listener regarding the aggregator there is another listener called `UncommittedDataListener`. the listener acts for notify you about the falling of sending uncommitted data into the admin-server. the `UncommittedDataListener` listener can be implemented for entire application.
