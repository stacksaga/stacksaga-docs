=== Creating SagaExecutionEventName Implementation (OrderStatus Enum)

All the executions can have an event-name based on the action like topic in kafka.
It is used for identifying the actions in the xref:admin:stacksaga-cloud-window.adoc[StackSaga Cloud-Window].
As an example after making the payment, you can indicate to the SEC the event as `MADE_PAYMENT`.
In StackSaga framework you can create an enum class by implementing from the `SagaExecutionEventName` interface.
The following event names will be used for the upcoming executors.
