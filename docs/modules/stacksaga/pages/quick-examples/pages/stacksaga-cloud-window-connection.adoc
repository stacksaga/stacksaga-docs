== Check connectivity with StackSaga Cloud-Window

To connect the orchestration service (Order-service) with the StackSaga Cloud-Window, we created an access-token for a specific user in the StackSaga Cloud-Window.
In this section, we are going to check the connectivity with the StackSaga Cloud-Window.

. Go the `https://live.stacksaga.org/` and sign with your GitHub account.

. Click the `connect` button to check the connectivity.
And then choose the *Gateway-Mode* and enter the root URL.
Due to we are in the local environment, the root URL is `http://localhost:8080` (API-Gateway Host) and put the target service's aliased name.
In our case the aliased name is identical to the service name called `order-service`. and finally click the `connect` button to validate.

If all the things are working correctly, you will be seeing an instance's data like above.
If you have multiple instances, every time the `connect` button is clicked the instance-id is changed. because the target-service is accessed via the API-Gateway due to the Gateway-Mode.
If it was used the Direct-Mode all the time, the result goes to the same instance.
